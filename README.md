WARNING: Using these files requires knowledge of FreeCAD
FreeCAD is unforgiving!
I have provided tips here, but you will need to figure out how to do those things yourself. I would love to write a tutorial, but it takes time.

FreeCAD Tips:

* The knurling pattern on the knobs makes FreeCAD insanely slow at re-rendering. I strongly suggest you turn on "Skip Recomputes" on the document, and recompute manually
* Size adjustments are done by modifying the FreeCAD spreadsheet values and "recomputing" the body
* To create an STL file, you will first need to create a mesh from the solid body, then export the mesh as an STL

3D Printing Tips

* Callibrate your printer... in particular the flow rate / extrusion rate. My Ender 3 S1 Pro needed 94% flow rate, and this improved hole sizing a lot
* Use a 0.2mm nozzle for a nicer result
* Use a small layer height
* Print on a RAFT... this prevents the elephants foot effect and massively reduces the amount of deburring you will need to do to make the buttons fit
